# ulw-research — synthesis format contract

`SYNTHESIS.md` skeleton — fill it as claims lock:

```
# ULW-Research Synthesis: <query>
Members + lanes: <total> · Waves: <count> · Excursions: <count> · Sources: <count> (<unique domains> domains) · Verifications: <count> · Debate rounds: <count> · Elapsed: <minutes> min

## Executive summary        — 2-3 paragraphs answering the core question
## Findings by theme        — per theme: consensus, evidence links, key quote (<20 words, attributed), verified yes/no
## Codebase findings        — absolute paths with line references
## Sources (ranked)         — URL, what it contains, reliability, access date
## Verified claims          — code: claim | verdict | verify-<slug>.md · non-code: only rows cleared into verified-claims
## Epistemic instrumentation — intent-vs-reality diff closure, claim graph coverage, observation manifest coverage, independent-observation convergence, verification economics summary, cause-disappearance records
## Debate record            — per contested claim: the attack, the defense, the verdict that survived
## Contradictions           — source A vs source B, resolution with evidence
## Gaps                     — what saturation could not answer · unresolved/refuted claim-graph nodes
## Expansion trace          — per wave: workers → markers; convergence reason
```

`SYNTHESIS.md` is the citation source of truth for final materials: every claim carries inline `[Source N]` citations, and every high-risk non-code claim you assert must be a verified-claims row from Phase 4b. Assert nothing the gate left in the unresolved/refuted annex and nothing the skeptic's attack left standing unanswered.

**Write the skeleton early and fill it as claims lock.** The moment the brief records the deliverable, create the deliverable file with its section headings and a `STATUS: draft — <n> sections open` line as line 2 (an HTML comment in HTML); that line is the partial-state marker `outcome state` reads, removed only when the deliverable is complete. An interrupted run must leave a partial report on disk, never an empty directory and a lost conversation.

**Keep sourced numbers, assumptions, and derived results visibly apart.** Every quantitative claim carries its lineage: `MEASURED` (a number a source states, cited), `ASSUMED` (a coefficient, distribution, or scope you chose — say why), `DERIVED` (computed from those, showing the formula), plus a sensitivity line whenever the assumption moves the answer. Presenting a derived estimate with the confidence of a measured one is the most damaging thing this mode can ship.

**Search in English, deliver in the user's language.** Retrieval stays English-first (search craft), but the synthesis and every final material are written in the language the user wrote to you in unless they ask otherwise — and a translated report still quotes its original-language sources verbatim.
