# ulw-research — search craft

English first: run every search in English by default — it is the largest, most authoritative corpus on every engine, GitHub, and documentation site. Add a secondary local-language sweep (1-2 lanes) only after the English sweep, when the topic is inherently local, or when the user asks for sources in a specific language.

Vary operators on every query — same query twice wastes a worker:

| Operator | Example | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `site:` | `site:github.com <topic>` | Restrict to a domain |
| `filetype:` | `filetype:pdf <topic> survey` | Papers, specs |
| `intitle:` / `inurl:` | `intitle:benchmark <topic>` | Targeted pages |
| `"exact"` / `-term` | `"<exact phrase>" -tutorial` | Precision, exclusion |
| `OR` | `<a> OR <b> <topic>` | Coverage |
| `before:` / `after:` | `<topic> after:2025-06-01` | Recency control |

High-yield combinations: official docs (`site:<docs domain>`), GitHub implementations (`site:github.com`), recent discussion (`site:reddit.com OR site:news.ycombinator.com after:<date>`), academic (`site:arxiv.org OR filetype:pdf survey`), changelog hunting (`changelog OR "release notes" <version>`), alternatives (`vs OR alternative OR comparison`).

X/social searches are unavailable in this runtime — substitute `site:x.com`/`site:twitter.com` web queries and indexed coverage (see the X/social role protocol in SKILL.md).
